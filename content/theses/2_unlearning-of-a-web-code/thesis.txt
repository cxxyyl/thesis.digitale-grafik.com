Thesisabstract:

This thesis examines the relationship between coding and design through the lenses of decolonization and unlearning theories. It explores who codes, for whom, and how code shapes our digital world, from local projects to global platforms, despite their vast differences in scale.

Focusing on the historical and socio-political dimensions of coding —including sexism, racism, classism, and capitalism — the study critiques the colonial structures embedded in coding practices. It draws on diverse disciplines to analyze how digital design often amplifies the biases of its analog predecessors.

As a Chilean, the author reflects on the challenges of understanding Chile’s role in global debates on colonialism while navigating a digital world shaped by endless lines of code. Despite the potential for global inclusion, many in the Global South remain on the margins of this evolving digital narrative.
