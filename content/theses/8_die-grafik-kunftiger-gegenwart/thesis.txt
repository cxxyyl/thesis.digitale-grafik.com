Thesissubtitle: Eine Untersuchung digitaler Benutzeroberflächen

----

Thesisabstract: This thesis examines how user interfaces have evolved and the role they play in shaping human perception and interaction in the digital age. Starting with early examples like the Command Line Interface (CLI), it traces the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) from their origins in military research to their presence in our everyday lives. The thesis explores how these interfaces balance technical limitations with human needs, adapting to become essential tools for work, communication, and social interaction. By examining past and present interface designs, the thesis considers how future interfaces might further shape our digital experiences and asks what we want these tools to become in an increasingly digital world.
