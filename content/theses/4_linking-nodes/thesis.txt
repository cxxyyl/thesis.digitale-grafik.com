Thesissubtitle: Systems of Hypertextual Knowledge Transfer on a Way Towards a World Brain. A Trail of Thoughts.

----

Thesisabstract: *Linking Nodes* explores modes of hypertextual knowledge transfer throughout human history, focusing on interlinked text systems from the 1960s to the Web of today. It juxtaposes them with the ideas of a *World Brain* (Wells, 1937), the *Memex* (Bush, 1945), and *Xanadu* (Nelson, 1966), exploring their visions for a thoughtfully designed global knowledge network. By analyzing early hypertext environments such as *FRESS* (Brown, 1968), *Intermedia* (Brown, 1985), and *HyperCard* (Apple, 1986), it reflects on their approaches to indexing, archiving, and accessibility. Revisiting technological solutions for citation, like *transclusion*, node granularity and linking mechanisms, such as multidirectional *backlinks* and *fat links*, it highlights the innovations of past systems and explores how their principles could inform future implementations.
