Thesissubtitle: A Heteroglossia of Three Oppositional Feminist Techno-Resources

----

Thesisabstract: This thesis explores the interplay between technology and gender through the lens of three seminal feminist techno-resources: Donna Haraway’s “Cyborg Manifesto” (1985), VNS Matrix's “The Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century” (1991), and Legacy Russell's “Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto” (2020). Each resource emerges from distinct historical contexts, yet collectively challenges the binary system that reduces gender to mere performance based on biological determinism. The Cyborg disrupts traditional gender roles through its exploration of human-machine interactions; the Cunt critiques male-dominated cyberculture; and the Glitch embraces the error as a site of identity fluidity.
