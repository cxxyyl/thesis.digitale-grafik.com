Thesissubtitle: Zwischen künstlerischem Medium und Expansionsinstrument

----

Thesisabstract: This study explores merchandise as a phenomenon in the modern creative industries, situated between artistic expression and commercial expansion. Standardized industrial products, now integral to everyday life, have evolved into carriers of stories and identities, with their functional value fading into the background. The term “merchandising” refers to strategies that boost attention for a primary product through associated items. This work examines merchandise as a medium that conveys and spreads a brand’s narrative, visible across diverse fields—from corporations like Aldi and Berkshire Hathaway to political institutions like the Bundestag. It views merchandise as a tool of an expansive cultural capitalism that transforms cultural values into standardized products, offering new avenues for identity construction and marketing.
