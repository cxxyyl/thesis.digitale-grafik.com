Thesissubtitle: In search of virtual agency

----

Thesisabstract: This thesis investigates the autonomy and virtual agency of generative artificial intelligence (AI) from a 2022 perspective. The first part of the thesis offers a historical overview, focusing on the Western, particularly America-centric, development of AI. The second part presents a series of experiments with text-to-image AI, aiming to capture this technology in its early stages. Through these explorations, the thesis examines AI's materiality and potential for collaborative interaction, offering a timely analysis of its evolving role in society.
