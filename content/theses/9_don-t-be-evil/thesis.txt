----

Thesisabstract:

This work explores the power structures within Google’s web search in the context of knowledge acquisition and digital interaction. Building on concepts of “power” from Michel Foucault and Miranda Fricker, it examines the role of search engines like Google. 

The analysis highlights how technical components such as indexing, ranking algorithms, user interfaces, and features like autocomplete shape user behavior and define their scope of action. It also delves into the connections between search engines, information production, and epistemic injustice. Through case examples and design considerations, the discussion illustrates how search engines filter, structure, and hierarchize knowledge, with significant implications for digital opinion formation.
