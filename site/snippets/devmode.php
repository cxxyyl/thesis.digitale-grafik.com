   ✦ Welcome to DevMode 👀 {㍶🔥zone} ✦
   ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾


   So now that you are here lets have some FUN with this website. Or maybe more like – we built some 
   nice tools for you to have some fun with the website on your own. Also we prebuilt some utilities for
   you, which could be handy. Maybe you found out how to activate DevMode already – if not here's how!

      

         You're able to             ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎ ◀︎
         drag the search            ____________________________________________________
         button to the             ⎛                                    ⎛    SEARCH    ⎞⎞  
         left. If you pull         ⎝                                    ⎝              ⎠⎠
         it fully to the            ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
         left it will change
         to DevMode. 
         


         ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► ►           To switch back to 
         ____________________________________________________          SearchMode drag the  
         ⎛⎛    DevMode    ⎞                                   ⎞         button back to it's 
         ⎝⎝               ⎠                                   ⎠         original position. 
          ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾            



   While you're in DevMode you are able to have some fun with commands and custom CSS. 
                                                              ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾     ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾        
         Quick Commands – We prepared some quick commands for you. Just type them into the input field
         ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾   and things will happen. Right now it's mostly color themes, but this can be
                           expanded in the future by you? The Idea is, that this version is a framework
                           which can be expanded/changed by you client side (on your pc) or also in a more
                           substantial way by writing a module which would be server side (for everyone).

         Custom CSS – – – Okay so how does this work. In the DevMode Module (js) is a function + cookies
         ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾       that saves everything that you write into a seperate <style id="devModeCSS"> 
                           element – except quick commands. The style element is also saved on your pc, 
                           so the changes you make to the css are permanet unless you delete the cookies 
                           for this website. Cookies are saved for 365 days. If you visit this website 
                           at least once a year you're good to go. After that your customisations will be 
                           deleted, same as deleting your cookies. 
                              So customise this site to your hearts content – if you want to. In case you 
                           made a mistake you can copy everything inside of <style id="devModeCSS">, 
                           delete the cookie and paste back into the input. This should also work for 
                           more complex (lot of) CSS written with a code editor. You should be able to
                           paste a completly new css into the input and it shoud (technically) work. 

                              I was also thinking about adding extra classes, that make syling the basic
                           elements easier, like "rows" "title" "year" etc. But I'm not sure if makes
                           things really easier. There is always the code inspector – so maybeeeeeeeeee?

                                                                                                -cxxyyl 
         
   The see whats under the hood go to /modules/devmode/devmode.js
