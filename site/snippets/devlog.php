2024-AUG-31     Vacation over! Time to travel by ICE again – 7hours of time for this project. Somehow I did not reserve seats at I  
cxxyyl          Ruhebereich, so  was wondering if it will be loud / hard to concentrate, but the trainride was quite peaceful today. Before 
                leaving I finally gave Oliver an update on the project and we will probably meet this week, to talk a bit :)
                    Today was fun tho, I did some ascii typedesign for one of the sections (search) but I did not finish it jet... but wow
                I think what I am doing here is the most inefficient and "unprofitable" way to make a website – but I truly love it to do it thihs way.
                Also the searchbar is a bit more complete now. Tags can be clicked/created/deleted! Now I need to finish the non-decorative features. 
                So tags acutally need to filter                                                          and by typing+return something into the input
                                             – quick thought – should it be an "and" (like normal) or an "or"
                field a tag also should be created. 
                    Okay, I think that's all for today. I'll be arriving at Hamburg HBF in 20 minutes. See you soon, Lohnarbeit calls (sadly)
                
            
                                    - quick thought – write to website not to person who is reading it.

2024-AUG-31     Okay I think I am done for this little vacation with working on the this site. Well I'll code a bit more on my way back
cxxyyl          to Hamburg. Everyone is out of our little vacation home right now and I'm enjoying the view and the few hours of calm 
                me-time I have now. But wow it's soooooooo hot. But back to what happend today!
                    Yesterday I managed to make the damn slider work, but I realized that it's still quite clunky and everything
                is breaking as soon as I resize the browser window. Also the position and size of slider-button was still a bit off. 
                After beeing done with all the small styling issues, I was still motivated enough to face this resizing issue. 
                For me refactoring everything to make it more modular was the solution I went with. So I spent the last few hours 
                rewriting / cleaning the js code. 

                ToDo List:
                - some additional styling for the DevMode Slider. Right now the sizes are still not finished ✓✓✓
                - window resize (ugh) maybe at some later point? ✓✓✓
                - commit

2024-AUG-30     Just came form mowing grass with one of these handmowers. What a workout. Nearly got half of the backyard done.  
cxxyyl          I've been coding for a few hours in the evening, here is my litte report for today :-)                
                    OK! Wow I struggled so much with this bit of js code but now the Seach<->DevMode slider finally works. 
                I made the first Draft with ChatGPT. the result worked on it's own, but I could not implement the code so it would
                work with everything that already exists. After trying a bit more with ChatGPT kind of gave up and came up
                with a solution that is a bit wonky – but whatever right? as long as it works. But Credit, where it's due –
                I think the general idea and some class names are still remnants of my first tests with ChatGPT.

2024-AUG-28     Wow! Last time I totally forgot that I had my dayjob... and I was just coding happily in the library. I wanted to have 
cxxyyl          a little break at home, but on my way back I realized I actually had to work. So no more coding. Currenty I'm in a train 
                again on my way to a week of vacation :-) So I will be able to focus a lot today. Really looking to spend my time 
                coding today. So happy <3 
                    Today I "solved" (lol) a big problem (for me). Rendering pretty code for inspecting the website, while using a 
                (Kirby) CMS / PHP. The solution was pretty easy – in hindsight... Just don't indent the php code at all. This "solution"
                feels so obvious? and underwhelming, but im so glad I'm finally able to get some clean™️ indented code. 

                ToDo List for Today: 
                    – look at the next step for commenting / adding info with kirby ✓✓✓
                    – indenting in a way it looks good wit cmd+alt+u / alt+u ✓✓✓
                    – Ideas for additional classes for DEVMODE ✓✓✓
                    – finish nav styling ✓✓✓

2024-AUG-22:    Between the Aug 15 and today I started to write this Log. Most of it was written today tho. I also managed to
cxxyyl          finally rename all the CSS classes using BEM, as Oliver and I agreed on. Currently I'm sitting at the Zentralbibliothek 
                in Hamburg – getting a bit hungry.

2024–AUG-15:    Happy Birthday! This website was uploaded for the second time ✨✨✨ Now at it's final home here on thesis.digitale-grafik.com <3
cxxyyl          Still hidden und unkown. I think nobody knows it's online yet. Reactivated the admin accounts of Christoph and Oliver.

2024–AUG-11:    Some minor tweaks to the frontend, renamed some classes for more clarity. And another heap of css!
cxxyyl

2024–AUG-10:    I guess with this now it's backendFinalFinalFinal. Some more little tweaks with the whole select your degree situation. 
cxxyyl          But just renaming things so it looks nicer in the frontend :-) Working a more on the frontend. Connecting more stuff like 
                the degree structure. Ah and not to forget the css! I wrote most of the code yesterday while on the train to Berlin and in
                this cafe i really love {WIM Kaffee}
                The commit was today tho :)

2024–AUG-08:    "Finalized" the backend. 
cxxyyl



⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆⏆
2024–JUL-05:    Oh and there was this problem of not beeing able to find pages if they are not published with the query I wrote
cxxyyl          But I solved that :-) In the end it was really easy. I just had to use .childrenAndDrafts() to get everything from the query.
                Also I added the structure for all the different degree combinations. And I corrected some typos in the tooltips
                    I went on another tangent with how to organize all the graduates. Christoph proposed that it would be nice, if every student
                had their own account with all their bio information. The maingoal with this would be to give every account very specific rights.
                So every account could only edit the page that was created with this specific account. But I did not find a way to do it, so this 
                never went any further then a test.

2024–JUL-04:    Today we had another consultation with Christoph – mostly about the backend. We talked a lot about potentional edge cases with
cxxyyl          graduates having different combinations of degrees. Like what if I finish a degree in fine art and then in teaching – and what 
                about the eventuality of someone doing a phd? So again a somewhat bigger rework of the graduate page and how that links to the 
                frontend. Good Times!

2024–JUL-03:    Oliver already did some work on the frontend {see Jun 27} and now I took over and connected a big part of the new frontend (again).
cxxyyl          With this I also found some more (small) issues in the backend and tweaked those.

2024–JUN-02:    Another round of working on the backend. I finished up all the little things, that needed to be done. The big new addition were are all 
cxxyyl          the tooltips I wrote for everyone using the backend in the future. Was very happy I did it, but also a lot of work 😤

2024-JUN-27:    We started a git repository for the project. Oliver was so kind to teach me the basics of usig git, 
cxxyyl          so i would be able to use it (as I never used it before). I learned that setting it up on Windows is such a pain, 
                but with the help of Olivers and Youtubes I was able to set everything up. We uploaded everything I did before on my own
                and had a good day of making progress with the frontend. Oliver set up basic css and js for the site, added the nav, 
                about, searchbar. I implemented a lot of the changes that came out of the consultation with Christoph {see May 08}.

2024-JUN-18:    Sadly Oliver could not join our first consultation with Christoph and Konrad, because I told him about it way to late. 
cxxyyl          We got some very good, some confusing feedback with our design for the website. It was quite interesting that Christoph
                and Konrad had such opposing options on some of the features of the website. Like sorting, the tags & search. With
                both of their feedback, we managed to simplify the website a bit more. Before there was still a scrollable element inside of the 
                accordion, which separated thesis and graduate. Now we unified it into one one big element.

2024-MAY-16:    Had a consultation with Konrad about my Graduation and BA Project {see Apr 11}. I think after talk – especially the following
cxxyyl          weeks – a lot of thing kind of started to click. And this whole idea of what I think code could be started to form. But of course
                not on their own. Especially here I want to thank you Polina https://polinsski.digitale-grafik.com/ for all the nice walks and interesing 
                talks about the web. So glad, that you are my friend <3

2024-MAY-08:    I had a big consultation with Christoph about the backend. It was very helpful, but i had to redo a big part of the backend from
cxxyyl          scratch. I had rebuild the site.yml from scratch. The pages for the thesis and the graduates also needed a major overhaul.

2024-APR-11:    First real talk with Oliver about what this project is. I think we came to a good agreement of what we want to do and what this website is.
cxxyyl          The design should be as clear and functional as possible. Maybe it's a bit, but thats okay. We wanted to add other features to the site
                that make it fun and interesting. For me personally one of the big important parts of the website is all of this. During this time the new
                Semester started and I had a consultation with Konrad about my BA Project and Graduation. This website – or what I want to achieve with this 
                website is somewhat of a testrun for many ideas i have about web development coding and the internet at large.

2024-APR-??:    Not that big of a deal, but I ported the backend to Kirby 4. Originally I wanted to use more of the new Kirby Features. 
cxxyyl          In the end it's only one {i think}. The link field – still amazing tho. But in the end I did not use it after all...

2024-JAN-24:    End of Semester Presentation at KDG. Talked about that I finished the backend and would be interested to collaborate with someone 
cxxyyl          one the frontend. Oliver https://www.paragraph.design/ {link is currently dead} was interested in joining the project.

2024-JAN-??:    Sometime before our presentations on Jan 24 & 25 I managed to sqeeze in connecting the backend to the frontend. With this the first part
cxxyyl          of the project was over. right? riiiight?? riiiighhhht ????

2023-DEC-29:    I vaguely remember that I working on the first iteration of the backend after christmas. I got covid for the first time -- crazy right? --  
cxxyyl          and was sleeping pretty much all the time for the christmas holidays. Once I was better I think I set up the backend in one or two days,
                while still beeing pretty cozy. Ah! This website uses the Kirby CMS https://getkirby.com

2023-NOV-08:    I think this could be the starting point of me reconstructing the earliest point of this project. It feels a bit like archeology 🔎
cxxyyl          It's crazy how badly i remember things and how hard it is for me to find out what was happening with his procent more than 
                half a year ago {-- writing this on Aug. 22, 2024} Im scrolling through old chats, google docs, and figma files to rebuild somewhat
                of a timeline... but it's sooooooo hard (-ω-、) 
                    I remember talking to Polina https://polinsski.digitale-grafik.com/, Very https://very.digitale-grafik.com/,  Akseli https://akseli.digitale-grafik.com/ and 
                Tiko https://www.are.na/tigran-saakyan/ in the weeks before about a semesterproject and the state of our class – or at least my 
                perception of brain-drain and so much of our collective knowledge beeing lost. So I kind of decided to at least make a little place 
                so everyone in class can access all the theses beeing written in our class. The presentation on this day was me asking the class
                what they would want / need from this archive – and if this is even a thing that is wanted or needed.
