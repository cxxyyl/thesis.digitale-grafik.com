          Howdy!

          Here you'll find a short guide on how to use this backend. There are two sections – your account and your thesis.

          1. Go to „Your Account“, you can find it on the bottom left side of the panel. Fill out all sections in the "Personal Information" and "Contact & Social" sections.
          <br>
          2. Go back to „Thesis“, you can find it on the top left side of the panel. At the top right corner of the „Your Theses“ table, click the +Add button to add your Thesis Page. Use the main title of your thesis as the page title.
          <br>
          3. Fill out the Thesis Page.
          Complete the Thesis Info section. Upload your written thesis as a PDF file in the File Upload Section. Link to your Thesis Website in the Mirror section. If you published your practical work on https://projekte.hfbk.net/, you can also link to it. 
          <br>
          4. Once you're finished, publish your Thesis Project by switching its status to "Published". 

          With this, you are done!
